EuropaPHP
=========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/treshugart/EuropaPHP.png)](https://travis-ci.org/treshugart/EuropaPHP)

EuropaPHP is an extremely fast, flexible and lightweight <del>M</del>VC Framework designed for PHP 5.4+.

Why Another PHP Framework?
--------------------------

EuropaPHP is the manifestation of the shortcomings of other PHP frameworks with a strong focus on modularity, scalability, standards, the view/controller relationship and dependency injection. It is specifically designed to be paired with your favourite libraries and it will seamlessly integrate with anything.

Installation
------------

You can either clone, download the source or use Composer:

    composer create-project europaphp/skeleton

All required framework components will be available and you should be able to start a server and see something:

    php -S localhost:3000 -t www

Then go to:

    http://localhost:3000

You can also see the available commands:

    bin/eu ?
