EuropaPHP
=========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/treshugart/EuropaPHP.png)](https://travis-ci.org/treshugart/EuropaPHP)

EuropaPHP is an extremely fast, flexible and lightweight <del>M</del>VC Framework designed for PHP 5.4+.

Why Another PHP Framework?
--------------------------

EuropaPHP is the manifestation of the shortcomings of other PHP frameworks with a strong focus on modularity, scalability, standards, the view/controller relationship and dependency injection. It is specifically designed to be paired with your favourite libraries and it will seamlessly integrate with anything.

Installation
------------

There are a couple ways to install Europa.

### Source

Download from Github and extract it to where you want it.

### Composer

    composer create-project treshugart/europaphp [installation path] [branch or tag]

If you want to use it as a composer package, just add `treshugart/europaphp` to your `composer.json` file.

Getting Started
---------------

To get up and running fast you can use composer to install some default modules. Just run:

    composer install --dev

And the modules `europaphp/main` and `europaphp/tests` will be installed. Once installed, you can run the base tests and begin writing your own.

Running Tests
-------------

From the install directory:

    php www/index.php test

Contributing
------------

To contribute, just fork and submit pull-requests. Each request will be reviewed and ideally include corresponding tests. If there are any updates to the API updating the documentation is also desirable.
